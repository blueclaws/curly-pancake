Yesterday I had an issue with nmcli that when I disocnnected from a wifi source and connected to another, nmcli wouldn't recognize the SSID of the wifi.
Looking at the man page for nmcli I was able to find a soultion.  
The radio was off aka *RADIO TRANSMISSION CONTROL COMMANDS*

So, I ran:  
`nmcli radio wifi on`

Voila it worked.
